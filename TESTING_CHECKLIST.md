## Known Issues & Notes

### ⚠️ Minor Notes:

1. **Add Book Functions (Books.jsx & BooksPage.jsx):**
   - Currently create TEMP books locally
   - `bookCopies` variable exists but not used in the temp book creation
   - Real books from API will have proper copy counts
   - **Impact:** Low - temp books are just for UI, real data comes from backend

2. **Copy Count for TEMP Books:**
   - When adding a book via the "Add Book" button, it creates a temporary local book
   - The copy count is not sent to backend (because there's no backend endpoint for adding books)
   - **Recommendation:** Either remove the "Add Book" feature or create a backend endpoint for it
