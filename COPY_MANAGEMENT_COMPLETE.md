# Book Copy Management - Complete Implementation

## ✅ All Changes Completed

Your library management system now fully supports multiple copies of books!

---

## 📋 Changes Made

### Backend (Django):

1. **BookStock Model** - Tracks quantity for each book
2. **BooksListAPI** - Returns `total_copies`, `available_copies`, `issued_copies`
3. **IssuedBooksAPI** - Validates available copies before issuing
4. **Auto-creation** - Books get 1 copy by default when first accessed

### Frontend (React):

#### 1. **Books.jsx** (Home Page)
- ✅ Added "Total" and "Available" columns to table
- ✅ Shows copy info in book detail modal
- ✅ "Number of Copies" field when adding a book
- ✅ Issue button only enabled when copies available

#### 2. **BooksPage.jsx** (Full Books Page)
- ✅ Added "Total Copies" and "Available" columns
- ✅ Shows copy info in book detail modal
- ✅ "Number of Copies" field when adding a book
- ✅ Status badges (green for Available, red for Issued)

#### 3. **TopChoices.jsx** (Top 5 Books)
- ✅ Shows copy info in book detail modal
- ✅ Issue button respects available copies

## 📖 How It Works

### For Librarians:

1. **Adding Books:**
   - Click "Add Book" button
   - Fill in book details
   - **Specify number of copies** (defaults to 1)
   - System creates BookStock entry automatically

2. **Viewing Books:**
   - See "Total Copies" and "Available" columns
   - Green badge = copies available
   - Red badge = all copies issued

3. **Issuing Books:**
   - Click on a book to open details
   - See available copies count
   - Issue button only works if copies available
   - System prevents over-issuing

4. **Returning Books:**
   - Click on an issued book
   - Click "Return" button
   - Available count increases automatically

## 💡 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Book
- Add "Introduction to Python" with 5 copies
- Total: 5, Available: 5, Issued: 0
- Status: Available (Green)

### Scenario 2: Partially Issued
- 3 copies of "Introduction to Python" issued
- Total: 5, Available: 2, Issued: 3
- Status: Available (Green) - still has copies

### Scenario 3: All Issued
- All 5 copies issued
- Total: 5, Available: 0, Issued: 5
- Status: Issued (Red)
- Issue button disabled

### Scenario 4: Return a Copy
- One copy returned
- Total: 5, Available: 1, Issued: 4
- Status: Available (Green)
- Issue button re-enabled

## 🔧 Managing Book Quantities

### Option 1: Django Admin (Recommended)

```bash
# Create superuser (if not already done)
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Then visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
# Navigate to: api > Book stocks
# Edit quantity for any book
```

### Option 2: Django Shell

```python
python manage.py shell

from api.models import BookStock

# Update a specific book
book = BookStock.objects.get(book_id='YOUR_BOOK_ID')
book.quantity = 10  # Set new quantity
book.save()

# Or create new stock entry
BookStock.objects.create(book_id='NEW_BOOK_ID', quantity=5)
```
